# Python Programming Blueprints
This is the code repository for [Python Programming Blueprints](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/python-programming-blueprints?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468161), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Python is a very powerful, high-level, object-oriented programming language. It has swiftly developed over the years to become the language of choice for software developers due to its simplicity. Python Programming Blueprints will help you build useful, real-world applications using Python.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All chapters have code files in their respective folders

The code will look like the following:

```python
def set_header(self):
    title = Label(
        self,
        text='Voting for hasthags',
        font=("Helvetica", 24),
        height=4
    )
    title.pack()
```
